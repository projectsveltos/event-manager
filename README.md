## Event driven framework in action

Sveltos supports an event-driven add-on deployment oworkflow:

1. define what an event is;
2. select on which clusters;
3. define which add-ons to deploy when event happens.

[EventSource](https://github.com/projectsveltos/libsveltos/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/eventsource_type.go) is the CRD introduced to define an event.

Sveltos supports custom events written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

Following EventSource instance define an __event__ as a creation/deletion of a Service with label *sveltos: fv*.

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventSource
metadata:
 name: sveltos-service
spec:
 collectResources: true
 group: ""
 version: "v1"
 kind: "Service"
 labelsFilters:
 - key: sveltos
   operation: Equal
   value: fv
```

Sveltos supports custom events written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). 
Following EventSource instance again defines an Event as the creation/deletion of a Service with label *sveltos: fv* but using a Lua script. 

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventSource
metadata:
 name: sveltos-service
spec:
 collectResources: true
 group: ""
 version: "v1"
 kind: "Service"
 script: |
  function evaluate()
    hs = {}
    hs.matching = false
    hs.message = ""
    if obj.metadata.labels ~= nil then
      for key, value in pairs(obj.metadata.labels) do
        if key == "sveltos" then
          if value == "fv" then
            hs.matching = true
          end
        end
      end
    end
    return hs
  end
```

[EventBasedAddOn](https://github.com/projectsveltos/libsveltos/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/eventbasedaddon_type.go) is the CRD introduced to define what add-ons to deploy when an event happens.

![Sveltos Event Driven Framework](https://github.com/projectsveltos/demos/blob/main//event-driven/event_driven_framework.gif)

Event manager is a Sveltos micro service in charge of deploying add-ons when certain events happen in managed clusters.
